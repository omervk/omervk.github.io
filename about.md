A veteran software developer of 16 years with a wide range of experience in leading roles, ranging from Dev Lead, through Architect to CTO. Major contributor to four startup exits. Impossibly passionate about his work. A generalist at heart with a strong emphasis on the backend and distributed systems, with a dash of machine learning on one hand and the user experience in the frontend on the other. Strong opinions, weakly held.

Currently looking for a high-level non-managerial technical role in a company which fosters an environment of professionalism and kindness, with a strong preference for companies that create a net positive impact. Ideal role would be 60-70% hands-on and the rest spent on architecture and other cross-cutting concerns, such as increasing company visibility, bettering engineering culture, mentoring engineers, etc.
